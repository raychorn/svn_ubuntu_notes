Re: SIOCSIFADDR: No such device eth0 After Dappr Upgrade
I got the exact same problem with Debian. Maybe somebody will find this helpful:

The problem started after I cloned a virtualbox os, and gave the box a new mac.

There is no /etc/iftab file anywhere, so I looked for all files in /etc containing the old mac with a "rgrep -i 08:00 *"

The only file that contained the mac was: /etc/udev/rules.d/z25_persistent-net.rules

Problem resolved after deleting the file, and rebooting.

==================================================================

jaunty 9.04

nano /etc/network/interfaces ; make all the eth's auto !

Then rm 70-persistent-net.rules
